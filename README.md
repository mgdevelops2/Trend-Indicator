# Ult-Day-Trading Indicator
  
  ## Description
  
This is a trading indicator built for the trading view platform, using PineScript - which is a language built by trading view based on python.

The project is simple, we are looking to increase the odds of us catching the trend with the use of a momentum "indicator". 
This momentum indicator, can be used with multiple asset classes. 

It incorporates: 
1. VWAP with 2 standard deviation calculations, which can be adjusted on the fly. 
2. 3 customizable EMAs
3. MACD cross confirmation.

The idea is to use VWAP as a long-term AVG , and use the EMAs as your intra-day short-term trend mean for mean reversion opportunities.
